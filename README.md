The employed models include RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier. The sampling techniques employed encompass Simple Random Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Bootstrap Sampling, and Systematic Sampling. Notably, Random Forest outperforms the others in terms of accuracy. The determination of the sample size is a crucial aspect of the analysis. Varied sampling techniques are applied to identify the optimal model that yields the highest accuracy.
